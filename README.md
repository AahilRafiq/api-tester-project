# api-tester-project
A simple apit-tester application , that uses axios for making requests ,and even used bootstrap for many frontend components.
In this project, we expect a client to test his API with basic HTTP requests like GET and POST requests.
Motivation of this project was to work with Axios, Bootstrap, Javascript DOM manipulation and even CSS knowledge.
#Warning:
Some of the API's are blocked by CORS POLICY.
